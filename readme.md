# Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.png?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/97bhavana/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> NOTE: Windows users should set `git config core.autocrlf true` to avoid format assertions failing the build (use `--global` to set that flag globally).

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
 
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer (full JDK not a JRE).
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
  * [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)

### Steps:

1) On the command line
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/97bhavana/spring-petclinic
    ```
2) Inside STS
    ```
    File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
    ```

    Then build STS launcher (right click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the css. Run the application main method by right clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

3) Navigate to Petclinic

    Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
